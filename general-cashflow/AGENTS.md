# General Cashflow source notes for the Business MCP task

- `GET /integrations/dot/reconciliation` is a read-only integration route. `CASHFLOW_DOT_EXTRA_TOKENS_JSON` adds separately scoped token hashes without rotating the existing connector token; raw tokens stay in a secret store.
- The route reads only receipt-day and older residual candidates. It does not prove refund completeness or resolution status; null remains unknown.
- All tests/builds and generated output follow `/Users/surachart/.solao-tools/SSD_POLICY.md`; deploy only from committed canonical source after the user's approval under root `AGENTS.md`.

## Named Admin access

- Keep the Admin operator list in `client/src/App.jsx` and `server/src/domain/cashierAccess.js` aligned: สา (`admin_sa`), โม (`admin_mo`), จ๋า (`admin_ja`), เพ็ญ (`admin_pen`), จุ๋ม (`admin_jum`).
- All five identities use the existing six-digit Admin PIN check. The server creates a distinct user on the first successful login and keeps disabled accounts disabled; adding a name does not require a schema migration.
